# Ice_Cream

The project “Ice Cream Particulates in Atmosphere” version GUI888 01 has been
created by ‘Group 888’ against the final project requirement for ‘Software
Development’ subject students of ‘2022 summer semester’.
As a final project, an application with GUI needs to be created with given
requirements [Ref. 11.1] and quality attributes [Ref. 11.2] to capture the
concentration value of ice cream particulates in the atmosphere at selected
locations around the country, called stations, and calculate the variance against a
target. Additionally, the variance needs to be presented in 2 views.
A Visual Studio application has been created that has been coded on C# in the
back end to satisfy the requirements. This document summarizes the purpose,
attributes (functional and quality), architecture, interaction, and the output of the
software. The document also captures the test cases used for the software
validation and verification.
